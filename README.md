# Exploring US Flights (Spark)

We investigated the Airline On-Time Performance Data Analysis. Our dataset comes from the US Bureau of Transport Statistics and includes the On-Time Performance for domestic US flights in 2017. A subset of the dataset can be downloaded from [the embedded URL](https://auebgr-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/louridas_aueb_gr/EbeTzde1LddFmqNWBFWWxNcBj5tDR_zvzDHvqqcmnndeEQ?e=Tb1orW).

Note: Because airlines were only indicated by their code in the 2017 performance data, we also downloaded the [carrier lookup table](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Download_Lookup.asp?Lookup=L_UNIQUE_CARRIERS), to include airline names in our results.
